### 🤔 The Problem (The "Why")

Many independent technicians manage their appointments through DMs, texts, or paper notebooks. This is time-consuming, disorganized, and prone to error. While large, complex salon software exists, it's often expensive and too complicated for a solo entrepreneur.

### ✅ The Solution (The "What")

This application provides a focused, simple solution. It gives technicians a clear digital calendar to manage their bookings and client information, accessible from any device, without the bloat of enterprise software.

### ✨ Core Features

* **View Bookings:** See all appointments in a clean daily, weekly, or monthly calendar view.
* **Manage Appointments:** Quickly create, edit, or delete appointments.
* **Client Database:** Store and retrieve client contact information for easy follow-up.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on both desktop and mobile, so it can be used at the salon or on the go.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project was built using a modern, efficient tech stack:

* **Front-End:** React
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **UI Components:** shadcn-ui
